1. Unpack the sources (seems like you got it already)

2. Configure the following paths for your setup. These variables 
   are located in the file tinyca itself.
   As of version 0.7.6 these settings should be configured in
   /etc/tinyca/tinyca.cnf. So there is no more need to modify
   the code itself. See tinyca.cnf.example.

@INC                    (location of the directory lib)
$init->{'opensslbin'}   (location of your openssl binary)
$init->{'templatedir'}  (location of the directory templates)
$init->{'zipbin'}       (location of your zip binary)
$init->{'tarbin'}       (location of your tar binary)

3. If you want to have german/spanish/czech/swedish texts:
   Generate the file tinyca.mo from po/de.po:
   msgfmt po/de.po -o locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/tinyca.mo
   msgfmt po/es.po -o locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/tinyca.mo
   msgfmt po/cs.po -o locale/cs/LC_MESSAGES/tinyca.mo
   msgfmt po/sv.po -o locale/sv/LC_MESSAGES/tinyca.mo
   or even more simple: call make in the directory po/

   If your locale is not set to german/spanish:
   export LC_ALL=de_DE.UTF-8
   or
   export LC_ALL=es_ES.UTF-8
   or
   export LC_ALL=cs_CZ.UTF-8
   or
   export LC_ALL=sv_SE.UTF-8
   before you call tinyca.

4. Call tinyca2, use it and report bugs :-))
